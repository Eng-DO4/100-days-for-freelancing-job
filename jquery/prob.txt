problem1:
alert has a problem as a callbackfunc:
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $(p).hide(3000, alert("p element is now hidden"))
    })

Question1:
Should dblclick() be 2 successive clicks on whole doc or it only sees the element?

Question2:
What will happen if we used callbackfunc in animate() and stoped this animation with stop() in its different cases?
